# P3D Spacey Layout Updates ([#23329](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/23329))

This PR removed the `LAYOUT` macro that was configured for the Spacey.
If you have a keymap for this keyboard, you will need to update your
keymap using the following steps:

1. Change your layout macro to `LAYOUT_all`.
2. Remove the two `KC_NO` keycodes following the Space and Delete keys
   on the bottom row.
3. Move the keycode for the encoder pushbutton (customarily Mute) to the
   end of the top row, after the customary Backspace key.
4. Move the keycode for the Right Arrow to the end of the Shift row,
   after the Down Arrow key.
